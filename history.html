      <div class="text-gray-700 space-y-10">
        <p>The journey of Superstar Football Club began in 2012, born from the passion and determination of a group of students in Northern Uganda. Far from home, these students shared a common love for football and a dream to create a team that would one day become a symbol of hope and excellence.</p>
        <p>What started as informal kickabouts quickly grew into a structured team. With resilience and a united spirit, they honed their skills and fostered a unique identity. This foundation, built on friendship and a shared vision, was carried back to Bor Town, South Sudan, where Superstar FC was officially established.</p>
        <p>Today, the club stands as a testament to their founding vision, continuing to inspire young talent and represent the pride of our community on and off the pitch.</p>
